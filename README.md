### Project development walkthrough
> - The idea of the 3ยบ Milestone project come from the need to organize and plan what movie I've watched and wich one I'm going to watch later.
I've found a nice and free movie api the [The Movie Data Base api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api), I just had to register, require for a permission, 
and credit it on my site, the will provide you an api key and all documentation needed to consume this data, allowing me to have a nice and well supplied source 
of movies images, information and constantly updated data.
First of all the plan was to display only movies, but then as the api provided this also, I've decided to use Tv shows informations as well, improving the site
making it more useful, interesting and atractive.
> - After I've started the development process, I've thinked on the wireframes on display the lists on several carousels, but I've changed my mind and
displayed all separetly let the visual more organized, and instead of displaying all lists at the same time, displaying the carousel content below on a grid,
some effects where add to the carousel as the zoom in options on mouse hovering, and setting the grid titles on high level of grey scale, zoom in when hovering
and as the final touch coloring then back while.
> - MongoDb
>    - The Database was designed to make easier to store and get the data as the site is used, follow the database Entity relationship:

</div>

##### back to [top](#table-of-contents)
> - My first challenge during the development process where with some bug on installing and genarate the requirements.txt because the "requests" library 
was declared and installed but for some unknown reason, wasn't appearing at the requirements file, which cause a bug when trying to run at heroku, because
that library wasn't found, after talked to my mentor and call the student care support, I've found a solution, adding the "requests" manually on the 
requirements.txt, what keep it there on the next time I've need to generate the requirements.txt file again. Idea of solution were found after talking
with mentor and student care and found this link on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36490897/how-to-install-python-module-extras-with-pip-requirements-txt-file)
> - Then the next challenge where to add animated checkbox to add to the movie lists as watchlist, wached, liked and favorite, the following example of checkboxes
where found [Animated Checkboxes](https://codepen.io/jaradlight/pen/IEbKq), but even so implementing then I wasn't enough skilled to make then work properly updating
the list information on the on-click, which lead me to add a form and a button to do so, and make this needed to update the movie lists, to set on or off, always 
on having the need to click to "update list"
> - So following on the development proccess I've come across some blank white spaces on my unordered list of movies displayed, which lead to me to apply the flexbox concept
found here[CSS flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) to not show those blank white spaces.
> - After this major challenges, I've add the rest of the site resources, not being capable to add the login using google account, found alot of difficulties 
to add the site to the https protocol, and probably the following steps, and the suggested movies section for the viewed movies, becoming this way left to implement features
